# colonie - a basic game about managing a colony
i did an activity in history class about maintaing a colony, but it only centeralized on colonists, so i thought to expand the idea
## this is just a bad reskin of *a dark room*
ah, but no. dark room is more complex than this, having rpg elements. plus i based the game off of dark room, which i enjoy **alot**.
